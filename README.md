# EXP|CON Concert
A multipage web application, with a purpose to show professionalism in execution of UX wireframes and digitally showcase the concert experience. EXP|CON contains three main pages: landing-page, pricing and payment. Components were modularized to reuse code where available on different parts of site (e.g. perks section on landing-page vs pricing). Payment system does not contain any use of Stripe for actual payments, but acts as the payment workflow experience.
